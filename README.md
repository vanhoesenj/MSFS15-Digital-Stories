# **Storytelling With Spatial Narratives**

The purpose of this short tutorial is to introduce the concept of a spatial narrative or [Michel de Certeau](https://github.com/vanhoesenj/MSFS15-Digital-Stories/raw/master/certeau.pdf) concept of spatial stories. Storytelling often has a geographic context that is can difficult to full grasp and more clearly articulated through the inclusion of an ancillary spatial narrative. This often takes the form of a single map shared as a frontispiece in a book that a reader references as they navigate the story but a variety of digital tools offer a more immersive experience where the story is told through or within maps themselves. Maps themselves typically tell a story but in this case their explicit use serves as the dominant narrator. But we need to heed Jorge Luis Borges' caution and make sure both the spatial narrative and/or map are actually required and not just incorporated because it's 'possible' -

We need to be thoughtful about the remediation process, which [Timothy Briggs](http://www2.bgsu.edu/departments/english/cconline/tbriggs/three_frameworks.html) describes as the: 
> "representation of one medium into another - have to consider what to include, what they add, what they move forward. Argues newer media can remediate older media and vice versa" 

Ultimately you want to do your best to avoid your readers having this experience:

and instead - by contextualizing your content with an appropriate and thoughtful spatial narrative - they will have this experience:

One of my favorite examples of using a spatial narrative to 'tell' the story is Dennis Wood's book ['Everything Sings'](http://sigliopress.com/book/everything-sings/) - a collection of maps he and his students created of the Boylan Heights neighborhood in Raleigh, North Carolina. Many of the stories in the book wouldn't be possible to tell without the embedded spatial component.
